# "The Great Old Ones" Total Conversion Roadmap

## Overview
"The Great Old Ones" transforms Vector War into a Lovecraftian horror strategy experience. Players command the Esoteric Order, a shadowy cabal seeking to awaken ancient cosmic entities and usher in an age of madness. The roadmap structures development across four phases that layer distinct awakening doctrines, human sanity systems, and eldritch escalation loops. Victory comes through conquest, corruption, or cosmic convergence—but the cost may be humanity's collective mind.

### Operation Re-skins & UI Hooks

Existing Vector War systems are re-themed for Lovecraftian flavor:

- **Intelligence Operations** → **Occult Operations**
  - `espionage` becomes **Scrying** (divination rituals revealing secrets)
  - `counter_intelligence` becomes **Ward Maintenance** (protecting Order from detection)
  - `cyber_offense` becomes **Memetic Corruption** (spreading eldritch ideas through digital networks)
  - `propaganda` becomes **Dream Broadcasts** (mass psychic messaging)
  - New mechanic: **Ritual Power Meter** on Operations sheet showing accumulated eldritch energy, appears after Act I tutorials
  - State gating checks Order council approved "Working Charter" before major rituals

- **Culture Warfare** → **Sanity Warfare**
  - `culture_bomb` becomes **Madness Epidemic** (mass hallucination events)
  - `meme` becomes **Forbidden Sigil** (eldritch symbols spreading through culture)
  - `cancel` becomes **Silence the Wise** (discrediting rational voices)
  - `deepfake` becomes **Possession Hoax** (fake possessions hiding real ones)
  - `eco` becomes **Blight Curse** (environmental disasters blamed on supernatural causes)
  - UI needs doctrine-tinted tooltips showing sanity drain rates
  - Campaign flag preventing Possession Hoax until Act II when Dream Invasion research unlocked

- **Bio-Warfare/Plague System** → **Madness Contagion System**
  - Plague types become **Madness Strains**:
    - Whispering Sickness (paranoid delusions)

    - Geometric Fever (non-Euclidean hallucinations)
    - Void Gaze Syndrome (staring into cosmic truth)
    - Metamorphic Curse (physical transformation)
  - Evolution tree becomes **Madness Evolution**:
    - Transmission: Mental (dreams), Social (cult recruitment), Media (cultural spread), Psychic (direct mind-to-mind)
    - Symptoms: Mild (anxiety, insomnia) → Moderate (hallucinations, paranoia) → Severe (violence, self-harm) → Terminal (complete breakdown, transformation)
    - Abilities: Resistance to therapy, stealth (appearing normal), euphoria (victims embrace it)
  - DNA points become **Sanity Fragments**
  - Cure progress becomes **Rationality Restoration**
  - Attribution becomes **Investigator Suspicion**

- **Nuclear Warfare** → **Ritual Casting**
  - Missiles become **Ritual Components** launched at target sites

### Campaign Completion Acceptance Criteria

- **Act Gates**: Players must clear all missions in each act and meet unlock triggers before subsequent acts spawn; mission generator retries cannot bypass High Priest votes or corruption thresholds
- **High Priest Votes**: Final act requires unanimous council approval or passed emergency override (2/3 majority plus entity favor) to greenlight finale mission, recording outcome for save-state continuity
- **Corruption/Sanity Thresholds**:
  - Campaign completion flags only if global corruption averages above 50% OR global sanity below 40%
  - For Convergence doctrine, requires Voluntary Conversion rate exceeding 60%
  - Exceeding inverse thresholds (too much resistance) branches into Investigator Victory end state requiring resolution before credits
- **Save-State Hooks**: Mission completions, vote tallies, corruption averages, summoned entities, and fallen investigators written to dynamic campaign state tree for scripting team to author re-entry beats and NG+ unlocks
- **Entity Favor Tracking**: Each Old One patron tracks player actions; favor score affects finale options and post-game outcomes

## 🎨 Unique Mechanical Innovations

### The Madness Contagion System
Building on Vector War's plague mechanics, madness spreads through:
- **Mental Transmission**: Dreams, visions, psychic contact
- **Social Transmission**: Cult recruitment, word of mouth, witness testimony
- **Media Transmission**: Books, films, art, music, internet memes
- **Environmental Transmission**: Proximity to ritual sites, eldritch artifacts, summoned entities

Each strain has evolution paths balancing:
- **Visibility vs. Stealth**: Obvious madness triggers investigation, subtle corruption spreads further
- **Lethality vs. Conversion**: Dead minds provide sanity fragments, living cultists provide utility
- **Euphoria vs. Terror**: Happy victims spread madness willingly, terrified victims alert authorities

### The Cosmic Alignment Calendar
Ritual effectiveness tied to celestial events:
- **Daily**: Lunar phase modifiers
- **Monthly**: Planetary alignments
- **Seasonal**: Solstices and equinoxes
- **Rare**: Eclipses, comets, stellar conjunctions
- **Legendary**: "Stars Are Right" events enabling Great Old One awakenings

Players must plan major workings around astronomy, creating strategic timing decisions.

### The Veil Integrity System
Replaces traditional stealth with cosmic horror themes:
- **High Veil (80-100%)**: Order operates in complete secrecy, minimal investigation pressure
- **Medium Veil (40-79%)**: Rumors circulate, investigators probe, authorities skeptical but alert
- **Low Veil (10-39%)**: Public awareness of supernatural, panic spreading, organized resistance forming
- **Torn Veil (0-9%)**: Open supernatural warfare, humanity united against Order, emergency powers enacted
- **Shattered Veil (negative)**: Reality itself unstable, physics breaking down, entities manifesting freely

Different doctrines optimize for different veil states:
- **Domination**: Thrives at low veil (fear is the weapon)
- **Corruption**: Requires medium-high veil (shadows enable infiltration)
- **Convergence**: Benefits from controlled veil lowering (gradual revelation)

### The Entity Hierarchy
Five tiers of summonable beings:
1. **Servitors**: Weak but expendable, minimal cost, low backlash risk
2. **Horrors**: Combat-capable, moderate cost, requires binding circles
3. **Star Spawn**: Powerful entities, high cost, significant backlash if uncontrolled
4. **Avatars**: Physical manifestations of Old Ones, extreme cost, regional disasters if control fails
5. **Great Old Ones**: Campaign-ending summonings, require multi-turn rituals, reshape reality permanently

Each tier has specific uses, risks, and strategic implications.

### The Sanity Economy
Dual resource system balancing:
- **Sanity Fragments** (harvested from broken minds): Liquid resource for rituals and summonings
- **Eldritch Power** (accumulated through workings): Battery resource decaying over time

Players must balance:
- **Harvesting vs. Converting**: Extract sanity or recruit cultists
- **Spending vs. Storing**: Use power immediately or save for major workings
- **Speed vs. Stealth**: Fast operations raise suspicion, slow ones risk investigator interference

Creating strategic depth in resource management.

---

## 🌊 Thematic Pillars

### Cosmic Insignificance
Humans are playthings of vast entities beyond comprehension. Victory may be survival, not triumph.

### Forbidden Knowledge
Learning eldritch truths grants power but costs sanity. Players face trade-offs between power and stability.

### Cyclic Nature
The Old Ones have risen before and will rise again. Even defeat is merely delay.

### Moral Ambiguity
Are the Old Ones evil destroyers or indifferent cosmic forces? Is awakening them extinction or transcendence? Players decide through actions and interpretation.

### The Price of Power
Every ritual has a cost. Every summoning risks disaster. Every conversion alienates the unconverted. Expansion requires sacrifice.

## 🌀 Conclusion

"The Great Old Ones" campaign transforms Vector War's strategic depth into a Lovecraftian horror experience. By layering madness mechanics, eldritch summonings, and corruption systems onto the existing framework, we create a unique campaign that maintains strategic challenge while evoking cosmic dread. The three doctrine paths provide diverse playstyles, while the dynamic investigation system ensures human opposition remains threatening. Most importantly, the campaign explores the fundamental question: what would you sacrifice to touch the infinite?
